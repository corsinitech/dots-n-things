# My Dotfiles
This is a simple repo for some important configuration files (dotfiles,
as they are referred to) that I want to carryover from one machine to 
the next. I currently utilize WSL on Windows 11 and and dual booted
with an Archcraft Distro for now (although that's subject to change).
Certain things, such as my Neovim config and zshrc, I like to keep 
consistent across platforms regardless of the host OS.
